# Motate

Motate: A high-performance multi-architecture bare-metal framework that is easy to learn and easy to use.

# Status

Motate is shaping up quickly, but is still in heavy development. It is currently being developed and tested inside the [Synthetos G2 project](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/).

**The interface for this code is still in flux.** Before the Motate system is completed I'll freeze the interface.

Please share any suggestions for changes. Pull requests welcome as well.

# Usage

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/synthetos/Motate/wiki).
